// social-api/src/pipeline/definitions-cache.ts
//
// Cross-user, in-memory cache of pipeline definitions, refreshed on a fixed
// interval (default 60s) by calling `definitionsRepo.listAll()`.
//
// Why this exists
// ---------------
// Two surfaces need a synchronous, all-users view of every pipeline
// definition:
//
//   1. The schedule evaluator in `src/index.ts`. It iterates every
//      published pipeline once per minute and fires the ones whose cron
//      expression matches "now". It used to read from a sync in-memory
//      mirror that the route layer wrote through to on every PUT — but
//      after a process restart that mirror was empty until each pipeline
//      got re-touched, so scheduled pipelines went silently dark.
//
//   2. The public webhook router in `src/routes/pipelineWebhooks.ts`.
//      `lookupPipelineIdByWebhookPath()` and `lookupWebhookSecret()` need
//      to map the URL path back to a pipeline definition (which is owned
//      by a specific user, but the URL itself is global). Same restart
//      blindness as above. Webhook receipt is a hot path — calling
//      DynamoDB on every POST would add ~10ms of latency and burn read
//      capacity on every signature check.
//
// What we do
// ----------
// Refresh on `start()` (eagerly, so cold-start blindness is bounded by
// Scan latency, not the tick interval) and then every `intervalMs` ms.
// Reads are sync — callers see whatever the last refresh wrote. Stale
// reads are bounded by `intervalMs`; we explicitly accept a ~60s
// propagation delay between PUT and the schedule/webhook surfaces seeing
// it (the route's PUT handler triggers a synchronous best-effort refresh
// to shrink that window for the common "save then test" UX).
