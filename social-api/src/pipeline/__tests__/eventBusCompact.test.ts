//
// Stream 4 (BusCompact): smoke test that verifies EventBus auto-compaction is
// wired through bootstrap → PipelineModule → EventBus. We:
//
//   1. Bootstrap with a per-test WAL path + a small auto-compaction interval
//      (200ms) and a small keepLastNPerType (2).
//   2. Publish several events of the same type onto the module's EventBus.
//   3. Wait for at least one `compact:completed` event (or the interval to
//      fire ≥ once).
//   4. Assert the post-compaction WAL has been bounded — we use the result
//      payload (`entriesBefore` / `entriesKept`) which is the most reliable
//      observation across timer racing.
//
// We deliberately publish on the bus directly (rather than going through
// `module.createResource`) because the compaction surface is bus-level —
// keeping the test focused on the wiring rather than pipeline run semantics.
//
// The test skips itself when the WAL parent directory isn't writable. In our
// jest env `/tmp` IS writable (bootstrap.test.ts's identity-file test exercises
// the same path), but the guard makes this safe to run in restricted CI.

import * as fs from 'fs';
// `distributed-core/testing` is a real subpath export — Jest resolves it via
// package `exports`. tsc with our current `module: commonjs` (classic
// resolver) doesn't honor `exports`. Suppressing here matches bootstrap.test.ts.
